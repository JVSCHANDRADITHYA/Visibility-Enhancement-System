# Visibility Enhancement System
A Visbility Enhamcement System for the First Responders and The Paramilitary Forces, Developed post-Sarvadrushti enabling native resoultion in-image processing and restoration abilities with embedded device depolyment and testing

Real-Time Dehazing & Deraining using CycleGAN

![Result](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3111af34-0818-4a73-8a8d-6bc296bd94f7)


This project introduces a **CycleGAN-based system** for **high-resolution multi-weather degradation removal**. Unlike conventional dehazing/deraining approaches, our model:  
- Operates on **native image resolution** 
- Handles **both haze & rain simultaneously**  
- Achieves **competitive state-of-the-art results** on benchmark datasets

## Key Contributions  
- ðŸ”¹ **Custom Dataset**: 7,614 unpaired images (synthetic + real) from REVIDE, Rain1400, and Dense-Haze  
- ðŸ”¹ **Architecture Modifications**: CycleGAN tailored for **high-fidelity restoration**  
- ðŸ”¹ **Training Optimizations**: ADAM optimizer, 100 epochs, unpaired image learning  
- ðŸ”¹ **Benchmark Testing**: Evaluated on **SOTS** and **O-HAZE** datasets  
- ðŸ”¹ **Results**: Achieved **PSNR ~29 dB** and competitive **SSIM scores**
- ðŸ”¹ **Deployment**: Succesfully DEployed on Jetson Nano Board 4GB with and inference time of about 15 seconds to process a 2K image

## Methodology
ðŸ”¹ Why CycleGAN?

CycleGAN enables image-to-image translation without paired datasets, making it ideal for visibility enhancement where paired clean-weather images are hard to obtain.

ðŸ”¹ Architecture

Generator: Translates hazy/rainy frames into clear frames

Discriminator: Ensures generated outputs are visually realistic

Cycle Consistency Loss: Maintains structural fidelity between degraded and restored images.
